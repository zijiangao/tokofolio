# tokofolio
Tokofolio is a Full-Stack Web application that allows you to track and manage all your crypto assets in real-time, analyze performance, and create custom portfolios tailored specifically to your needs. This was a personal project for me as I have used a number of crypto tracking applications over the years and know what I like and, more importantly, what I don't. Courtesy of the Coin Market Cap public API, a basic search feature for up to 6000 tokens is possible without registering as a user.  Additional features are unlocked after registration. The app is still a work in progress - particulary I would like to improve on the transitions between pages and add charting functionality.   All in good time. Look forward to hearing your feedback!
